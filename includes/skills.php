<h3>Extracurricular Skills</h3>
<p>During high school, from grades 9 to 12, I participated in the <a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition</a> or FRC.  
During 6 weeks, teams had to design, build, and program a robot basically from scratch.  
During these competitions, I learned how to work effectively as a team extremely well.
I also learned how to work under a time constraint because building a large robot in 6 weeks only after school and on weekends does not give alot of time for the project.
A third thing I learned from this experiance is how to work under a budget, because our team had little financial support and needed many supplies to make the robot.

<br><br><br>In addition to my experiance in FRC, I also am an Eagle Scout. My Eagle Scout project was making restorations to a local church.  
Some of the restorations that I made were that I tore down an unsafe deck, I made a sidewalk for the pastor, and I fixed an older Eagle Scout project and made it more sustainable.
The old Eagle Scout project was an outdoor walkway in the woods for the inhabitants of the church and it was overgrown with weeds.  I tore out all the weeds, fixed any of the old parts of the nature walk that needed repaired, and ensured that it would be cared for in the future.
My Eagle project taught me how to lead a large group of people effectively, and how to work under a budget, because I had to fundraise all the nessissary money for the project.
